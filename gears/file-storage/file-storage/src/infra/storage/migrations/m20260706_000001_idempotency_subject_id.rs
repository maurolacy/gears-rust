//! Bind idempotency keys to the authenticated subject (P2 remediation 0.10).
//!
//! `idempotency_keys` previously carried no notion of *who* created a given
//! key — the composite key `(tenant_id, owner_kind, owner_id, idempotency_key)`
//! is derived entirely from the request body, so one caller could guess/reuse
//! another caller's `(owner_id, key)` tuple and, together with the ordering
//! bug fixed alongside this migration, receive a live upload URL for a file
//! they never created and are not authorized to write.
//!
//! This migration adds a `subject_id` column recording `ctx.subject_id()` at
//! insert time. It is **not** added to the primary key — the domain layer
//! (`FileService::create_file`) fetches the record via the existing composite
//! key and then verifies `record.subject_id == ctx.subject_id()`, treating a
//! mismatch as `Forbidden` rather than silently falling through to a fresh
//! create (which would otherwise race the still-live row on insert).
//!
//! Deliberately **not** coupled to 2.1's `request_hash` column: 2.1 is not
//! landed on this branch, and coupling an unrelated, already-necessary Tier 0
//! fix to a not-yet-designed follow-up would only add churn risk here.
//!
//! Existing (pre-migration) rows have no real subject on file; they are
//! backfilled with the nil UUID, which can never equal a real
//! `ctx.subject_id()`, so any in-flight replay of a pre-migration key is
//! correctly treated as a subject mismatch (`Forbidden`) rather than being
//! silently trusted.
