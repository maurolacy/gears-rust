//! Plugin-facing backend-provider traits (DESIGN §3.4 / §3.7).
//!
//! A plugin implements one or more of these traits to turn operator-supplied
//! config options into a running backend plus a shutdown hook. The wiring crate
//! (`cf-gears-cluster`) collects providers into a [`ProviderRegistry`] and
//! dispatches each profile's per-primitive binding against it.
//!
//! All four provider traits live in the SDK so plugins implement them while
//! depending only on `cluster-sdk`, never on the wiring crate. Options arrive as
//! a raw `serde_json::Map` (the wiring strips the framing `provider` and
//! `secret_ref` keys before the call), keeping the SDK free of any config schema.
//!
//! **Omit-default shorthand**: a profile that omits a primitive gets the SDK
//! default backend over the cache (`CasBasedLeaderElectionBackend`,
//! `CasBasedDistributedLockBackend`, `CacheBasedServiceDiscoveryBackend`). An
//! explicit binding always wins.
//!
//! **Non-cache providers do not receive the cache backend.** If a plugin natively
//! implements leader election (e.g. K8s Lease) it builds that backend from its own
//! options; it does not need the cache. The wiring layer provides the cache only to
//! the SDK-default auto-wrap path, not to native providers.

/// connection) — Postgres, Redis, NATS, and etcd all need it. The trait is
/// `#[async_trait]` so plugins can `.await` that setup directly instead of
/// deferring it behind a readiness gate or a background task. The wiring
/// crate (`cf-gears-cluster`) calls providers from an already-`async fn`
/// context (`RunnableCapability::start`), so this never needs `block_on`.
