//! Operator YAML schema for the cluster gear (DESIGN §3.4 / §3.11).
//!
//! [`ClusterConfig`] is the operator-facing contract: a map of named profiles,
//! each binding the four coordination primitives to a backend `provider`. The
//! `cache` binding is the required anchor; the other three may be omitted to ride
//! the SDK default backends over that profile's cache
//! (`cpt-cf-clst-fr-routing-omit-default`), or bound to their own provider for
//! per-primitive routing (`cpt-cf-clst-fr-routing-per-primitive`).
//!
//! These types are serde-deserializable (typically via `ctx.config()` in a host
//! gear, fed by `serde-saphyr`). They live in the wiring crate, not the SDK — the
//! SDK coordination contract stays serde-free per `cpt-cf-clst-constraint-no-serde`.
//!
//! Per-provider options are **flattened** into the backend binding and parsed by
//! the provider itself (see [`crate::provider::ClusterCacheProvider`]), so adding
//! a backend is a new crate plus config, not a schema change here.
